=SPEAKERNOTES=

So, we held a hackathon recently,
and we liked the experience so much that
we have already planned for yet another

=SLIDE=

## Current & Next

Software at different stages

![](img/hackathon-poster-01.jpeg)   <!-- .element: class="small" -->

=SPEAKERNOTES=

Before diving right into hackathons,
let’s first talk about a couple of paradigms that a software dev company
would typically need to think about

=SLIDE=

## Current & Next

- Maintain software which customers are using
- Build “next generation” software
- Balance: Tech debt vs green-field

=SPEAKERNOTES=

First paradigm is that there’s a tug of war between,
on one end, fixing and maintaining software that’s already out there in the field,
with customers using it, paying for it, and expecting it to work;
and on the other end, building the next big thing that’s going to do all these new things.
You can’t afford to focus all of your time and energy on one to the neglect of the other,
a balance needs to be found.

=SLIDE=

## General & Specific

Splitting up software

![](img/hackathon-poster-02.jpeg)   <!-- .element: class="small" -->

=SPEAKERNOTES=

Another paradigm is about where & how to split your software up.

=SLIDE=

## General & Specific

- Build something useful for Autopilot
  - Some parts: General purpose
  - Some parts: Business specific
- The split happened organically

=SPEAKERNOTES=

There are various approaches to this, & one of them is to answer the question
"Is this specific to my business, or is this more broadly applicable?"
for each part of the software.
Then put all the specific things in one repo,
and all the general things in another repo.

=SLIDE=

## General purpose

- Also proved to be useful architecture
- General purpose parts can be open sourced

=SPEAKERNOTES=

This is makes for useful architecture.
And, this also paves the way too open sourcing the general parts.

=SLIDE=

## Hackathons

- current vs **next**
- **general** vs specific

![](img/hackathon-poster-03.jpeg)   <!-- .element: class="small" -->

=SPEAKERNOTES=

Currently, our plan is to run hackathons themed around using the
general purpose parts of the next gen projects.

=SLIDE=

## Knowledge sharing

- ~3 devs working on each project
- How much do the other ~20 devs know about this project?
- One team “hosts” a hackathon themed around using their project
- Workshop prior to hackathon

=SPEAKERNOTES=

We have a small number of the devs working on any one project,
and the rest largely don’t know much about it.
Left to go on like this, eventually domain knowledge about each project tends to be very silo’ed.
So how do you nip this in the bud, and get everyone on board,
and share the knowledge?
We used a hackathon that was hosted by one of the teams.
Leading up to the day, the team ran a practical session where the rest
learnt the fundamentals of using their project, a workshop.

=SLIDE=

## Event organisation

- Posters
- Cater lunch, drinks, snacks
- Have presentations on next day

=SPEAKERNOTES=

Make the hackathon an event, because it is one. Put up posters around the office,
blog posts, slack announcements, etc.
Treat it with the same importance as as an external event,
market it internally, make sure that no one is going to turn up on the day,
and say "Oh, today is the hackathon is it?"
Instead it should be top of mind,
and everyone has thought of potential ideas ahead of time.

Another thing that we did was to hold the presentations the next day,
rather than on the same day,
so that the full day can be used for actually making and building.
Otherwise it would really wind up being a half-day affair.

## 1st edition

What we built

![](img/hackathon-poster-04.jpeg)   <!-- .element: class="small" -->

=SPEAKERNOTES=

… and then we built some things on the day itself.

=SLIDE=

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/hackathon-projects-01.png" -->

- Habit tracker - Daily checkin with your habits <!-- .element: class="fragment whiteOnBlack" -->
- Gamblebot - Analyses how odds change during a match <!-- .element: class="fragment whiteOnBlack" -->
- Mealhack - Slackbot with mealpal auto-order & reminders <!-- .element: class="fragment whiteOnBlack" -->

=SPEAKERNOTES=

Here’s some of what we built

=SLIDE=

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/hackathon-projects-02.png" -->

- Giving Autopilot a voice - Use Alexa to control autopilot <!-- .element: class="fragment whiteOnBlack" -->
- Drink water app - Track daily water consumption <!-- .element: class="fragment whiteOnBlack" -->
- Maestro- Remote replay + visualisations from MIDI keyboard <!-- .element: class="fragment whiteOnBlack" -->


=SPEAKERNOTES=

… and some more

=SLIDE=

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/hackathon-projects-03.png" -->

- Newer Relic - server health monitoring <!-- .element: class="fragment whiteOnBlack" -->
- Desk sensor - track standing desk heights <!-- .element: class="fragment whiteOnBlack" -->
- Brainfuck interpreter - functional conditionals & new Turing tarpit <!-- .element: class="fragment whiteOnBlack" -->

=SPEAKERNOTES=

… and yet more

=SLIDE=

## What we built

- Everything used the project of the “host” team (that was the rule)
- Some were itch scratchers
- Some were life hacks
- Some were things that Autopilot might actually use

=SPEAKERNOTES=

We built a whole range of things from voice commands to server monitoring,
from web apps to hardware hacks.
But all of them made use of this one particular project.

## Pros & Cons

of running an internal hackathon

![](img/hackathon-poster-05.jpeg)   <!-- .element: class="small" -->

=SPEAKERNOTES=

So, what’s in it for us?
And, what’s in it for you if you participate in or organise internal hackathons too?

=SLIDE=

## Cons

- Lose 1 day of development time

=SPEAKERNOTES=

It has to be said that while we’re building all of these cool things,
the business-as-usual dev works is put on hold.

=SLIDE=

## Pros

- Other teams know how to work with the project of the “host” team
- Flushed out bugs
- Surfaced novel use cases, & new ideas
- General purpose —> fun things

=SPEAKERNOTES=

We got a lot of benefit out of it though.

As anticipated, knowledge sharing increased.
Also as anticipated, since we used the general purpose project, fun and crazy ideas were built.

The host team got a lot out of it too, as the sudden frenzy of users using it novel ways flushed out bugs, and also surfaced new features that might be nice to have.

=SLIDE=

## Future

What’s in the works

![](img/hackathon-poster-06.jpeg)   <!-- .element: class="small" -->

=SPEAKERNOTES=

After all of that, we’re pretty keen on holding more hackathons.

=SLIDE=

## Future

- Continue hacking, pivot, spin off??
- Open source general purpose projects
- Another team “hosts” next hackathon
- Invite guest participants

=SPEAKERNOTES=

Some of the things that we built are worth continuing to work on
Some of them could be open sourced too.
The next hackathon will be hosted by a different team, and we even thinking of inviting guest participants

If you have run hackathons at your company,
I would like to hear about your experiences too!
