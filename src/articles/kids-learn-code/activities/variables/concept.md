## Learning Outcome

- What should the student learn, briefly stated
- e.g. Student should learn how to use a variable to represent a value

## Analogies & Metaphors

- List pairs of programming concepts and their corresponding analogy  or metaphor
- e.g. a variable is like a cardboard box with a name written on it, the box represents the stuff that has been put inside the box

## Techniques

- Building upon the analogies and metaphors listed above, describe techniques used to teach students the connection between one an another
- e.g. For a variable that represents and integer (whole number), put a number of marbles into the box

## Activities

- List of activities based upon the techniques listed above
- For each activity list any possible safety precautions that should be taken
- e.g. Get students to assign values to a variable by putting items into a box, and retrieve the value of a variable by looking at what is inside the box, and modifying the value of a variable by replacing the items inside the box.
- e.g. If putting marbles inside boxes, and the students are too young, there is a risk of swallowing/ choking in the marble. If this is the case, use an alternative type of object that poses no such danger.

## Knowledge & Skills

- What the students should learn, stated in detail
- For each thing learnt, what would demonstrate that it has been learnt
- e.g. be able to declare a variable, assign an initial value to a variable, inspect the value of the variable, and alter the value of a variable
- e.g. Putting identifying that the word written on the box is the name of the variable. When multiple boxes are present, the value of the correct one is inspected.
