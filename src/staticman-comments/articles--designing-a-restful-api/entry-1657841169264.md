Hi there,

As you'll know, Guest Posts are one of the most powerful backlinks you can get for blog.bguiz.com - and they are easy to do yourself.

The problem is, they can be expensive if you buy from an agency or reseller. By working directly with the website/blog you can get your backlink at a fraction of the cost.

Agencies are charging $400 and upward for a single backlink, but if you contact that site directly, would cost you nearer to $40!

Our list contains over 6,500 handpicked websites that accept guest posts, with each site's SEO metrics and contact details, allowing you to contact them all directly.

Kind Regards,
Felicity
