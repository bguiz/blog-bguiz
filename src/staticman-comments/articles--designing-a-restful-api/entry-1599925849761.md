Hi,

We'd like to introduce to you our video creation service which we feel may be beneficial for you and your site bguiz.com.

Check out a few of our existing videos here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3nEeQoTtOE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaMaDwX7tBU
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jT6ve94xig

All of our videos are in a similar format as the above examples and we have voice over artists with US/UK/Australian accents.

- We can convert one of your online articles or blog posts into video format, as many people prefer to watch a video as opposed to reading a page or document.
- We can explain your business, service or product.
- We can also educate people - these videos are great at educating the viewer on something such as the facts or history of a subject.
- They can be used for Social Media advertising, such as Facebook Ads.

Our prices are as follows depending on video length:
0-1 minutes = $159
1-2 minutes = $269
2-3 minutes = $379

*All prices above are in USD and include a custom video, full script and a voice over.

If this is something you would like to discuss further, don't hesitate to get in touch.
If you are not interested, simply delete this message and we won't contact you again.

Kind Regards,
Kate
