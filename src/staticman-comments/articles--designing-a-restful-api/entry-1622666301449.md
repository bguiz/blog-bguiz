Hi,

We're wondering if you've ever considered taking the content from netlify.app and converting it into videos to promote on social media platforms such as Youtube?

It's another 'rod in the pond' in terms of traffic generation, as so many people use Youtube.

You can read a bit more about the software here: https://www.vidnami.com/c/Vijay8-vn-freetrial

Kind Regards,
Roma
