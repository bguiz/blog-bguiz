Hi, 

We're wondering if you'd be interested in a 'dofollow' backlink to bguiz.com from our DA50 website?

Our website is dedicated to facts/education, and so can host articles on pretty much any topic.

You can either write a new article yourself, or we can link from existing content. The price is just $50 and you can pay once the article/link has been published. This is a one-time fee, so there are no extra charges.

If you're interested, please reply to this email, including the word 'interested' in the Subject Field.

Not sure what DA is? Have a read here: https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority

Kind Regards,
Erica
