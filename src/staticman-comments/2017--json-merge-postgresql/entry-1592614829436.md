Hey, first of all thank you! This helped me out a great deal.

I think the first two case conditions should be 

when keyOrig isnull ...
when keyDelta isnull ...

The difference is checking whether the keys are null instead of whether the values are null. The reason is a call like this

select jsonb_merge_recurse('{"a": 2}'::jsonb, '{"a": null}')

Here you are explicitly saying you want the value of key "a" to be null. I would think this should override the previously set value of 2.
