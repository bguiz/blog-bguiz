There's always more fish in the sea. 
https://vasilko327.com 
To the victor go the spoils. 
When the oak is before the ash, then you will only get a splash; when the ash is before the oak, then you may expect a soak. 
Oil and water don't mix. 
Be careful what you wish for. 
There's no such thing as a free lunch Link to proverb. 
Never let the sun go down on your anger.
