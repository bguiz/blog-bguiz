This book is a comparison of the two leading/ popular Javascript front end frameworks
&hellip; in 2014.

As of today, this book is:

- Useless: None of the code samples are of any practical use,
  as the frameworks have changed so much since the book was written.
- Useful: In understanding what the parts of a Javascript front end framework are,
  and perhaps, abstractly, what too look out for when choosing between them.
