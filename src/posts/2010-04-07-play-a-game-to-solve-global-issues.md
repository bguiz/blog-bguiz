<p>Came across this new game called Evoke, whose objective is to expose players to various global causes and issues* through a fun medium. Quite smart, using MMO-style skill points and in-game rewards to promote what would otherwise be a rather bland message- and it comes as a comic to boot.</p>

<p>* food security, energy, water security, disaster relief, poverty, pandemic, education, human rights</p>
<p>A sample comic from one of the episodes:<br />
