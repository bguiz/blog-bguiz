<p>Inception is one helluva concentration-intensive edge-of-your-seat type movie. However, this blog is not your run of the mill list of of things I did each day types &#8211; so why blog about a movie, you ask?</p>
<p>Well, at the end of the movie I had a little discussion, and my take was that it really was not all that confusing, if you thought of it in terms of recursion. Add a couple of weeks and a little inspiration from another discussion thread, plus several years of reading <a title="XKCD" href="http://xkcd.com" target="_blank">XKCD</a>; and voila I drew a comic. Enjoy.</p>
