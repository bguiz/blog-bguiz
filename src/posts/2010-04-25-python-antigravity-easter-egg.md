<p>Was reading some old XKCD, and I came across this one:<br />
<a href="http://xkcd.com/353/" target="_blank"><img title="I wrote 20 short programs in Python yesterday.  It was wonderful.  Perl, I'm leaving you." src="https://i0.wp.com/imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png" alt="Python" /></a></p>
<p>So, on a whim, I decide plug it in. I would encourage you to try it too:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
import antigravity
</pre>
<p>Spoiler: <a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/antigravity.py?view=markup&amp;pathrev=66902" target="_blank">python antigravity easter egg</a> as evidenced in python&#8217;s source code (circa 2008)</p>
