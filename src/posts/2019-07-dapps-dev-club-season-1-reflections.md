We've recently published
[a recap of DApps Dev Club's first season](https://dappsdev.org/blog/2019-07-14-dapps-dev-club-season-1-recap/),
where we thanked everyone who has helped run the events,
before doing a round up of the *entire season*.

What was missing from that though,
are my personal reflections from running this club.
I felt there were a great many take aways -
there were a great many good things that we accomplished,
but also a great many opportunities for improvement that exist.
There were also many things learned along the way.

A few of you who have been coming to the sessions regularly
have heard me talk about these ad hoc in the mid-session
F&amp;B intermissions or after-session breakouts.
In the **spirit of openness**,
I felt it would be for the greater good to share these more broadly.
Here goes!

**Legend**

- 👍 ⟹ This went well
- 👎 ⟹ An opportunity for improvement
- 🤔 ⟹ Learnt something

In, no particular order, and prefixed with the symbols above,
here are my reflections&hellip;

<!-- excerpt -->

## Reflections

- 🤔: community management
- 👍: kueh
- 🤔: AV skills, including HDCP
- 👎: should have switched to pizzas sooner
- 👍: logo
- 🤔: auto-didactism
- 🤔: how to handle heckling
- 👎: duration per session
- 👎: the solidity session should have been split into two
- 👎: the web3 session should have been split into two
- 🤔: would like to have explored the ethereum fork of the anders blockchain demo further
- 👎: the explanation of cryptography should have been improved
- 👍: the explanation of testing quadrants
- 👎: should have a standard vagrant or docker set up, especially for windows users
- 🤔: metamask has a reset cache button
- should switch to a lapel microphone for recording (too soft)
- 🤔: events are a lot of work, I have a 70-point checklist that needs to be executed per session
- 🤔: getting sponsorship is a lot of work, need to allocate more time for it
- 🤔: graphic design skills
- 👎: certificates
- 👎: projects didn't quite pan out, but it looks like hackathons did in their stead.
- 👍: lots of networking, got too meet lots of interesting people, and learn about lots of interesting projects
- 🤔: two sessions per month is unsustainable as an organiser, going to switch to one per month, like every other meetup
- 🤔: get more guest speakers in for particular topics
- 👍: eventbrite
- 👍: discord
- 👎: telegram for announcements
- 🤔: need a co-organiser
- 🤔: social media, I don't like it, but everyone else does
- 👎: need to be more consistent at marketing
- 🤔: singaporejs book club format
- 🤔: projects didn't work out, but hackathons did
- 👎: venues can cancel on you at the last minute
- 👎: demos need to be more interactive
- 👍: workshops were very popular
- 👍: javascript testing using mocha was a very big hit
- 🤔: how to get the difficulty level of workshops right. in a meetup, cloze-passage style workshops work best
- 🤔: built my own solidity diff display tooling, but perhaps using an existing tool would have been better
- 🤔: handling heckles. only got one in the entire season.
- 👍: javascript testing using mocha was a very big hit
- 🤔: suggestions made that I should compile all the material into something accessible online
- 👍: "hackathon starter pack" post from NBC'19 was a hit, received many thanks for putting that together

## Things to research

- ECIES without client-side or centralised-server-side key management
- EIP712 example
- Etherlime and ethers.js
- Block explorers and other visualisations
- Expand on state machine driven development, since it was popular in NBC'19

## Open sharing

- 🤔: meta: DApps Dev Club would not have been able to record its sessions,
  if not for the [EngineersSG wiki](https://github.com/engineersftw/gitwiki).
  Paying it forward with open sharing here too.

## Next season

DApps Dev Club is *planning* to hold its next ~~session~~ season soon!

&hellip; but we would like to hear from you first!

- What are the other networks that you would like to build DApps on?
- Are there any upcoming hackathons that you would like to build a DApp at?
- What would you like to learn about in DApps Dev Club season #2?
- Do you have a venue that we can use for session in season #2?
- Do you have cash to splash to sponsor sessions in season #2?

Please join the
[DApps Dev Club chat group](https://bit.ly/dadc-chat)
and let me know your answers to the above.
