  Try out the activities from the activities day yourself!

If you would like to follow along by doing the activities from the
[RSK+RIF Activities Day](/2022/dogfood-your-web3-ecosystem/)
on your own, this is the post for you!

Note that this post is a list of the activity cards;
The solutions and spoilers have been saved for a subsequent post!

![Original activities format](/images/posts/dogfood-your-web3-ecosystem--planning-objective-card.png)
*The original design of the activities ☝️*

![IRL activities card](/images/posts/dogfood-your-web3-ecosystem--irl-objective-card.png)
*The physical cards for the activities used on the day ☝️*

The rules are that these have to be completed sequentially -
complete each objective before moving on to the next one.
Consider doing this **in a group** rather than individually.
However, if that is not an option, some activities may not 100% work,
and you'll need to adapt accordingly (suggestions have been provided inline).

You might notice that some of the cards contain an **Easter Egg**.
These are for doing something more than just the base requirement of the activity.
As the name implies, these are not specified in the activity cards,
finding them involves some guess work (and luck).
All team members need to to complete the basic steps to move on to the next activity,
but only one team member needs to - optionally - complete the Easter Egg
in order to get the additional points.

## OBJECTIVE #1

> You have 30min to set up a *new* Metamask Wallet in a *new* Browser Profile of your computer and connect to *RSK Mainnet*.
>
> Existing/current wallet *not allowed*. Save your seed phrase!!!
>
> Then sign into the link below and connect to RSK Mainnet + add RIF token - [metamask-landing.rifos.org](http://metamask-landing.rifos.org)
>
> Every member of the team must submit the address at: forms.gle/XXXXX
>
> Reward: 10 points

This objective is simply the set up for the rest of the sequence,
so that everyone starts on a level playing field, with a fresh wallet.

Adaptations:

- Use a spreadsheet or other shared doc instead of the google form.

## OBJECTIVE #2

> You have 5min to select your team name!
>
> Write and show your name to the public.
>
> Be creative
>
> Reward: 10 points

This objective is simply to populate the leaderboard with names instead of team numbers.

Adaptations:

- This task is simply to enable teams to appear on the leaderboard
- Skip if not competing with multiple teams

## OBJECTIVE #3

> Two members of your group will receive RBTC from IOV.
>
> Transfer among yourselves such that everyone has equal amounts.
>
> You can check account balance at [explorer.rsk.co](https://explorer.rsk.co/)
>
> You have 25min for this task!
>
> Reward: 20 points
> Easter Egg: 20 points

This objective is to ensure that everyone has sufficient funds to perform the tasks in the rest of the sequence.
The amount needed is approximately 10USD worth of RBTC.

Adaptations:

- Transfer in RBTC that you hold in another account; or
- Obtain RBTC from an exchange
- If doing this individually, skip the distribute equally step, instead just transfer to another one of your own accounts

## OBJECTIVE #4

> You have 30min to convert your 50% funds from RBTC to RIF Tokens.
>
> You must use [`app.rskswap.com/swap`](https://app.rskswap.com/swap) or
> [`live.sovryn.app/swap`](https://live.sovryn.app/swap).
>
> Reward: 30 points

This objective is to convert some cryptocurrency into utility tokens,
which will be used in some of the subsequent tasks.

## OBJECTIVE #5

> You have 40min to register a new RNS Domain (e.g. `yourname.rsk`)
>
> Your domain must last for 2 years.
>
> You must use [`manager.rns.rifos.org`](https://manager.rns.rifos.org/).
>
> Reward: 40 points
> Easter Egg: 20 points

This objective is to use some utility tokens,
to register a decentralised domain name.

## OBJECTIVE #6

> You have 20min to lend approximately 2USD worth of RBTC on Tropykus using the “microsaving” feature.
>
> You must use [`tropykus.com`](https://tropykus.com/).
>
> Reward: 60 points

This objective is to use cryptocurrency as savings to earn an interest.

## OBJECTIVE #7

> You have 30min to mint RDOC on Money On Chain.
>
> You must use [`rif.moneyonchain.com`](https://rif.moneyonchain.com/).
>
> Reward: 60 points
> Easter Egg: 20 points

This objective is to convert utility tokens into a stablecoin,
which will be used in some of the subsequent tasks.

## OBJECTIVE #8

> You have 45min to purchase a limited edition “IOV Gorra Digital Edition” from Kripton Market.
>
> You must use [`marketplace.kriptonmarket.com`](https://marketplace.kriptonmarket.com/).
>
> Reward: 60 points

This objective is to use a stablecoin to purchase a retail item.

Adaptations:

- These items may no longer be available, purchase any other item with approximately the same value instead.

![So it wasn't really digital after all](/images/posts/dogfood-your-web3-ecosystem--irl-purchase.png)
*Mini-spoiler: The "digital edition" was a bit of a troll 😉,
this activity was really about the purchase of a physical cap;
and was revealed right at the end of the activities.*

## OBJECTIVE #9

> You have 10min to uninstall your Metamask wallet from your new Browser Profile.
>
> Reward: 10 points

This task is to simulate "losing" your wallet.

## OBJECTIVE #10

> You have 35min to recover your wallet but now using Defiant (mobile) or Liquality (browser).
>
> Ensure that your addresses/balances are intact. Hint: Check your derivation path.
>
> Reward: 100 points

This task is to recover funds after "losing" your wallet.
