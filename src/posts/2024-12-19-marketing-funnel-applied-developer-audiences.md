Hello readers of my blog! ðŸ‘‹

Â [Bianca Buzea](https://biancabuzea.com/about/), [Tessa Kriessel](https://www.tessakriesel.com/), [Michiel Mulders](https://de.linkedin.com/in/michielmulders) and I are teaming up to write a four-part series of articles about Developer Relations! Sneak peak, here are their titles:

- Developer Relations is not Developer Marketing
- How to Position DevRel within a Tech Company
- The Marketing Funnel Applied to Developer Audiences
- Developer Experience (DX)

It has been an excellent collaboration, and Iâ€™m honoured to work with some of the top minds in the DevRel space on this! Cannot wait to push publish on these in the new year.

Happy 2025!
