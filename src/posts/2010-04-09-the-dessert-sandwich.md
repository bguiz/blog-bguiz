<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>2X slices of bread, frozen</li>
<li>Nutella (chocolate spread)</li>
<li>Thick custard</li>
<li>Chocolate ice cream</li>
</ul>
<p>How it happened:</p>
<p>Was too lazy to plug in the toaster to defrost the bread this morning &#8211; so I decided to make something that would go well with frozen &#8211; ice cream, of course! Already had the nutella out, so that went in&#8230; but it didn&#8217;t quite hit the spot. Then I thought of custard &#8211; and thus the dessert sandwich was born. It is awesome.</p>
