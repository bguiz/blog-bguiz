<p>An interesting question. IMHO - yes, yes school children should have at least the opportunity, and the exposure to it.</p>

<p>The killer quote for me was:</p>

<p>I think that it is a pity that that is the case, considering our increasing dependence on technologies in our day to day live s. I reckon that it is a good cause, and one worth supporting.</p>
<p>They have a petition on their site (non-US signers are Â welcome to sign). This site is more than just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism" title="define:Slacktivism" target="_blank">slacktivism</a> though:</p>
<ul><li>If you indicate that you are a software engineer, it gives you the option to volunteer your time.</li>
<li>If you are a teacher, it links you to resources for bringing coding to the classroom.</li>
<li>If you are a student, it links you to Scratch, Codecademy, Khan Academy; and a whole array of other resources, a lot of whom I am hearing about for the first time.</li>
