<p>Paul Irish, platform evangelist for Google Chrome, breaks this down for us: <a href="http://paulirish.com/2013/webkit-for-developers/" title="WebKit for Developers" target="_blank">Webkit for developers</a></p>
<p><strong> tl;dr</strong> -</p>
<p>Not all Webkits are equal. Webkit has a plethora of different implementations, and each of them differs slightly. Not to worry, because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/LayoutTests" target="_blank">layoutTest coverage in WebKit</a> is enormous (28,000 layoutTests at last count), not only for existing features but for any found regressions. In fact, whenever you’re exploring some new or esoteric DOM/CSS/HTML5-y feature, the layoutTests often have fantastic minimal demos of the entire web platform.</p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2013/02/testing_the_open_web_platform.html" target="_blank">W3C is ramping up its effort for conformance suite testing</a>. This means we can expect both different WebKit ports and all browsers to be testing against the same suite of tests, leading to fewer quirks and a more interoperable web. For all those who have assisted this effort by going to a <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/" target="_blank">Test The Web Forward event</a>… thank you!</p>
