Published a small, but hopefully useful, package to
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/project-of-file) today,
to scratch this itch:

Q: Given the full path relative of a file,
how do you determine what project it belongs to?

A: [`project-of-file`](https://github.com/bguiz/project-of-file)

Hope you find it useful!
