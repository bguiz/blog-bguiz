DevRel Uni is an immersive program that runs for six weeks, welcoming a new batch of students each year. This program is designed to provide an enriching learning experience for those passionate about the Developer Relations (DevRel) profession. I had the privilege of being part of this program this year (2024), and here is what I learned.

## The DevRel Uni Program

Each week is packed with activities:

- **Guest Speaker Sessions**: A session with a DevRel pro, sharing their insights and experiences.
- **Twitter Challenges**: We were encouraged to tweet daily about DevRel, to foster a habit of active engagement. Many of us used this to reflect on each week's session, and share additional materials. Some of us also used this to build/ learn in public (more on that later).
- **Assignments**: These require significant effort and commitment, pushing students to apply what they learn in a practical context.

Organized by [Bianca Buzea](https://x.com/buzea200), DevRel Uni boasts an impressive lineup of speakers including [Steph Orpilla](https://x.com/0ceans404), [Patrick Collins](https://x.com/PatrickAlphaC), [Austin Griffith](https://x.com/austingriffith), [Nader Dabit](https://x.com/dabit3), and [Michiel Mulders](https://x.com/michiel_mulders). They are seasoned pros in the web3 DevRel space, and imparted a wealth of knowledge and experience to us.

**From Inspiration to Action**

In DevRel, there are always many things that you know you should be doing, but don't actually get around to. I'm really thankful to DevRel Uni for giving the permission + encouragement to overcome this hurdle on a few fronts.

Twitter: I have always been an occasional Twitter user, and default to spending more time writing code - see [ShipTalkers](https://shiptalkers.dev/compare?name=bguiz) + [context on twitter](https://x.com/bguiz/status/1799375655702036990) - but that is a vestige of my being a software engineer previously. I've come to realise just how important being active on Twitter is for DevRel, especially in web3. DevRel Uni's Twitter task was actually fun, and I ended up producing a [mega Twitter thread](https://x.com/bguiz/status/1790231257244438853). Also, here's a [Twitter list of the entire DevRel Uni 2024 batch](https://x.com/i/lists/1797917799312166951), which I suggest you follow!

Build and learn in public:  [Shawn Wang](https://twitter.com/swyx) (a fellow Singaporean ðŸ™Œ) has an amazing article, [*Learn in Public*](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), which I've read years ago, but never put into practice. DevRel Uni gave me the all-too-important push to finally get onto this. This took the form of starting a [YouTube channel dedicated to Hands-on DevRel](https://www.youtube.com/@doDevRel?sub_confirmation=1), where I record myself doing everyday DevRel tasks, and narrate my thought process, and occasionally throw in some tips.

Cross pollinating ideas: Compressing so much information from a different set of speakers into a short time period is challenging, but also rewarding from a synthesis point of view. Doing a short retrospective each week led to many a brainwave, and the theme was taking idea A that I was already familiar with prior, and "marrying" it with idea B that I had just been exposed to from one of the guest speakers, to form idea C which is something novel. Then I've turned that idea C into actions. This took the form of messaging my DevRel team, with the intent to put it into practice. Here is one of those messages, which I think exemplifies this:

**A Diverse Learning Environment**

Our batch comprised a fascinating mix, from those aspiring to start or switch careers to DevRel, to established professionals. This diverse group created a dynamic environment conducive to peer learning, with most interactions happening in a lively Telegram group chat, that often overflowed onto Twitter.

There was a rather interesting moment around 2 weeks into the program,
when [I discovered, through memes,](https://x.com/bguiz/status/1796895069154500983)
that two of my batch mates had attended
a [webinar that I gave on DevRel as a profession](#TODO_LINK)
just months before.

## Best Ideas from the Speakers

Throughout the program, several key ideas stood out to me from the various speakers:

- **Bianca Buzea**: Start a new DevRel role with a bang - have a 30-60-90 day plan.
- **Steph Orpilla**: Important to consider the user experience (UX) of developers reading your documentation.
- **Patrick Collins**: DevRel's goal is to get developers to **know, use, and love** your technology. Focus on what people care about and using edutainment (education + entertainment) to deliver your message. Formula for continuous improvement: A-B test, learn, iterate, and repeat.
- **Austin Griffith**: Get developers tinkering with Solidity as fast as possible; target two minutes, optimise like crazy till you get there. Build the tools you wish you had, and make them public; if theyâ€™re useful, theyâ€™ll get popular.
- **Nader Dabit**: Repurpose content for maximum reuse [^devrel-do-things-for-multiple-reasons] - turn something into a demo repo, an article, a workshop, a conference talk, et cetera.  Also, build in public and share your learning journey. (This validates Shawn Wang's philosophy.)
- **Michiel Mulders**: Design optimal learning journeys for different segments. Supplement documentation with technical videos.

## Best Multiplier Ideas

Some ideas from multiple speakers resonated deeply and revealed underlying themes:

- **Steph Orpilla & Michiel Mulders**: Think in terms of frameworks or methodologies when planning developer documentation. Use resources like [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) and [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/about/).
- **Patrick Collins & Austin Griffith**: Embed metric collection mechanisms in educational materials to measure effectiveness. If you are A-B testing, you need to know which side of the test performs better to inform you next iteration.
- **Nader Dabit & Austin Griffith**: Online and asynchronous resources almost always provide better ROI than in-person events.
- **All speakers**: Developer education is the most important part of DevRel. If there is only only thing that you do in DevRel, this is it - so expend the majority of your effort on education.

**Common Threads and Contrarian Views**

Interestingly, while these ideas were shared by multiple speakers, there was an undertone suggesting that the DevRel profession often gets these aspects wrong. This supposedly contrarian viewpoint might indeed be the "secret sauce" that sets apart top calibre DevRel professionals.

## What Should Have Been Covered

While the program was comprehensive, I felt a few areas could have been explored more:

- **DevRel Strategy**: How do you design a DevRel program, and structure a team and processes to deliver it? That is the top line question in DevRel strategy. I speculate that these aspects weren't emphasised as much due to the focus on newcomers to DevRel.
- **Developer Success and Tooling**: When developers build using your tech, how do you maximise the chances that they will be able to complete their task? There is an entire practice area within DevRel that focuses on this. However these were touched on but not truly explored with the rigour I felt they deserved.
- **Navigating DevRel Within Organisations**: As a relatively new niche, DevRel is less well understood within tech companies. This poses unique challenges. These were only briefly touched upon.

On a related note, if you're in Singapore or a similar timezone, the weekly sessions happened at around 3am - which made it quite challenging. I hope that future sessions can be held around 9pm to midnight (which is 9am to noon in EST), or asynchronous attendance options are available.

## Top 3 Takeaways

Condensing all the learnings, here are my top three takeaways:

1. **Dev Education is the Primary Focus**: Devote *at least half* of your DevRel resources to it. Plan a systematic, comprehensive approach to documentation.
2. **Async Over Sync for Events**: Emphasise webinars with recordings over in-person events. This nets you a much higher ROI.
3. **A-B Test and Iterate**: Choose good metrics and ensure you have mechanisms to measure them effectively.

**Are you keen?**

Reading a summary about DevRel Uni cannot fully capture the true experience of being part of it. Whether you are starting your career in DevRel or seeking to sharpen your skills, I highly recommend [enrolling in the next batch of DevRel Uni](https://www.devreluni.com/).

[^devrel-do-things-for-multiple-reasons]: If you have worked with me, you would have heard me saying "in DevRel, never do anything for just one reason", so it was great to be validated.
