tl;dr= I'm giving a talk on
[Haxe](http://haxe.org/ "Haxe The Cross-platform Toolkit") at
[a Javascript conference](http://vi.campjs.com/ "CampJs VI"),
here are the [slides](/presentations/haxe-for-javascripters/ "Haxe for Javascripters - slides")

Do you use a **compile-to-Javascript** language?
Have you gotten stuck when running Javascript on **different devices**?
Why am I talking about not-Javascript at a Javascript conference?

Haxe is a language that can compile to Javascript,
in addition to 8 other languages,
and even **compiles natively** for some targets.
It is heavily inspired by **ECMAScript**,
so it can be picked up in less than a day if you already know Javascript.

(as an aside, if you like Typescript, you'll love Haxe)

It is a mature language to boot - it has been around **for a decade** now.

... The only thing is, hardly anyone has heard of it,
and I think that that's quite a shame -
My goal for the talk:
to get this virtually **unheard of** language
the attention & headspace I think it deserves.

In *Haxe for Javascripters*, I'll be covering:

### ECMAScript

The history of ECMAScript, the set of standards implemented by Javascript,
and how this relates to Haxe.

### Community

What the Haxe community is like to be a part of.

### Haxe to JS

Speaking at a Javascript conference about ... not Javascript? ...
Well not quite - I'm not that crazy!
In fact Haxe has a Javascript target,
and it will the focus of the talk!

### Pros/ cons

Highlight some of the pros & cons of Haxe,
and compare them to other compile-to-Javascript kits.
(I've stolen some material here from [Andy Li](https://twitter.com/andy_li) - thanks Andy!)

### Demo

Cap it all off with a demonstration of the Haxe to Javascript target.
Time permitting, perhaps even the *other* targets that Haxe compiles to.
