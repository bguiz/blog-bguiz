<p><a title="The Reinvigorated Programmer" href="http://reprog.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">The Reinvigorated Programmer</a> (Mike Taylor) quotes from Jon Bentley’s 1986 classic Programming Pearls:</p>
<blockquote><p>Only 10% of programmers can write a binary search</p></blockquote>
<p>Shocking indeed</p>
<p>Better yet, he has a coding challenge for you to take part in (post answers as comments):</p>
<blockquote><p>Here are the rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use whatever programming language you like.</li>
<li>No cutting, pasting or otherwise copying code.  Don’t even look at other binary search code until you’re done.</li>
<li>I need hardly say, no calling <span style="color:#800000;">bsearch()</span>, or otherwise cheating <span class='wp-smiley emoji emoji-smile' title=':-)'>:-)</span></li>
<li>Take as long as you like — you might finish, and feel confident in your code, after five minutes; or you’re welcome to take eight hours if you want (if you have the time to spare).</li>
<li>You’re allowed to use your compiler to shake out mechanical bugs such as syntax errors or failure to initialise variables, but …</li>
<li><strong>NO TESTING</strong> until <em>after</em> you’ve decided your program is correct.</li>
<li>Finally, the most important one: if you decide to begin this exercise, then you <em>must</em> report — either to say that you succeeded, failed or abandoned the attempt.  Otherwise the figures will be skewed towards success.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you have attempted this, there is his <a href="http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/binary-search-redux-part-1/" target="_blank">redux</a>, on why coding exercises like this matter; and his <a href="http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/testing-is-not-a-substitute-for-thinking-binary-search-part-3/" target="_blank">redux of the redux</a>, on why you should not test while attempting exercises like this. They are all worth a good read.</p>
